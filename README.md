# Abstract

_AI is the new electricity. As an electrical energy solar panel is generating electricity for its owner and can redirect to the grid the surplus thus generating passive income for its owner so it is our Project and much more._

The advancement of AI research, development and adoption in day to day use cases in industry such as security, safety, online and offline retail, distribution, healthcare has been growing rapidly in recent years. Blockchain-based technologies such as smart-contracts and entire ecosystems such as rapidly growing Ethereum, Solana or BNB, Polygon networks are empowering decentralized applications. Web 3.0 is a present reality that has the potential to revolutionize the global ecosystem. The proposed whitepaper and the underlying ecosystem - addressed as “_**Project**_” in this document - combines the latest research and development in the area of decentralized approaches both in AI and blockchain-based smart contracts in order to create a utility blockchain network where AI processing nodes collaborate, perform jobs based on real-life use-cases, generate passive income for their owners and direct income for service provider network participants such as developers, maintainers and other stakeholders.

_**We envision an organic growth based on the partners that will resell and integrate the initial core safety & security features launched as well as growth based on development partners that will target even radically different industries from safety and security**_.
