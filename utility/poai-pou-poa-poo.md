# PoAI, PoU, PoA, PoO

The concepts of Proof-of-Availability as well as Proof-of-Ownership strictly are tied to the Node Deed (eg. license NFT). When a Participant buys a Node Deed, the PoO basically generates a limited time revenue for the owner of the NFT no matter if there is an actual node running (that has the Node Deed associated with). On the other hand PoA generates a limited time revenue for the owner of the NFT if and only if there is a actual node up-and-running (even idle) associated with that deed. Remember, you can buy node licenses at one time and install your node at another time. While PoO is generated continuously the PoA is strictly tied to the node uptime of the associated node and can thus be discontinued.&#x20;

Although the node is built and centered around providing a multitude of highly complex AI features and scenarios for multiple domains, each node has no "default" AI behaviour by itself as all AI functions are job (function, feature) related and must be requested by someone - either by the node owner or by an external entity. So, when the participants want to put their nodes (with its associated licenses) to work for their own needs (such as using a few existing surveillance cameras to detect perimeter intrusion between certain hours or stream live video with live human/features confidentialization) they need certain plugin(s) that they have to pay a monthly/yearly license for in tokens (Note: there are a few free plugins but let us assume we are talking about a paid one). At this moment they are putting the owned devices (node) to work for their own needs (personal or business) and they will get a rebate from the periodic fees (linear, not exponential this time) via the Proof-of-Usage.&#x20;

Now, let's say Tim has his node up and running and doing lets say perimeter intrusion and pet detection for his own home and he's still in the first 12 months of usage he will get revenues from Proof-of-Ownership (he has the Node Deed), Proof-of-Availability (he is already using the node so the node is alive in the network), Proof-of-Usage (he bought from a network service provider the licenses for the 2 features). However, at some point, as per your example, he needs more power (maybe he wants to process a big CCTV movie in a short time with some AI plugin) and he gets the suggestion from the node software that he can use other nearby nodes for extra power. If he accepts a mainnet microtransaction is executed and the funds will be delivered to the Node Deeds that are associated with the nodes that received the job from Tim - those nodes performed PoAI and the funds are delivered via the deed NFT to the NFT owners.

Lets say we have a company - ACME - that develops a complex application using the ecosystem and clearly needs lots of distributed external power within the decentralized network of nodes, so again a mainnet transaction is approved by ACME  and  executed and the resulting funds are distributed as PoAI revenue to the respective node owners (that are nearby to ACME and received the job). Maybe even Tim from previous example is also nearby, his node is only 20% used while tracking cats, dogs and suspicious neighbors :) - thus he automatically receives a part of the ACME distributed funds as his node automatically performs a PoAI job as part of a larger batch of jobs initiated by ACME.
