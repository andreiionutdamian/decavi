# Utility and use-cases

The Project targets multiple real-life utility use cases, a broad range of business related aspects as well as technological horizontal issues. Thus, the taxonomy of the ecosystem utility and uses-cases can be divided in the below main categories yet it all starts from a basic utility: we see each box-node as an **AI-powered processing “land” asset** of our decentralized network processing-Metaverse. Each individual node has its own **Node Deed non-fungible token** that entitles its owner to **various rights** including active (and even passive) **revenue streams** generated from the **workload** of the node, from **usage** of paid features or subscriptions or from the simple **ownership** of the Node Deed.
