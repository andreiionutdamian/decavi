# Advanced end-to-end Execution Engine

* Transparent **pay-as-you-go** blockchain based processing-provisioning in network decentralized edge infrastructure
  1. **Service providers** and develop, experiment and deploy complex distributed/decentralized architectures that would require large Cloud-based processing power in a flexible, scalable and highly optimized grid of decentralized edge nodes - for example a grid of 16 Nvidia A100-80 GPUs can be “simulated” by 100-150 nodes that use consumer-grade GPU computers ranging from gaming stations to personal mobile workstations.
  2. **End consumers** can seamlessly deploy their workload on free or partially-free nearby nodes while the processing usage fees are automatically and transparently distributed based on blockchain technology
* **Template based ready-to-use software and compute infrastructure** for various applications ranging from commercial safety & security to Smart City solutions and up to blockchain gaming:
  1. **Legacy-based applications**: Easy to develop and deploy complex business logic in applications forked from the base functionalities based on low code plug-in development for various pipeline aspects such as data acquisition plugins, neural model serving plugins, business logic plugins. Target industries and domains include but are not limited to:
     1. Commercial AI video-analytics security
     2. Industrial safety based on AI video-analytics
     3. Industrial supply chain predictive analytics
     4. Retail and distribution predictive analytics
  2. Develop new applications that will use already in-place tokenomics and plugin-based execution pipelines with ready to use API and documentation. New applications, programming logic and business models can be programmed starting from proposed Templates (such as “Real Time Predictive Analytics”, “Simulation Game Template”, etc). Various target industries have been identified but we strongly believe that many other can benefit from our ecosystem:
     1. Industrial predictive maintenance
     2. Automotive fleet management & insurance industries
     3. Gaming industry (simulation gaming, etc)
