# The Solution

While architecting the solution our entrepreneurs realise AiEXPAND can solve the majority of their issues as follows:

1. The problem of end-to-end development of the complex required backend processing can be offloaded to the network of processing node ecosystem that already solves problems such as efficient real time multi-modal data acquisition either at edge-device or Cloud level, deep learning or even heuristics based model serving, business logic low-code and no-code deployment. Based on these features they can focus on further tuning their models as well as focusing on creating a modern and fluid user experience with a UX/UI team. A major development and software systems maintenance cost is basically erased from their projections.&#x20;
2. In terms of compute power they acquire a single AiXPAND Node Deed and tie it to a mobile GPU workstation in order to have their own "entry point" within the AiXPAND network and run their internal tests and POCs. Nevertheless in terms of compute resources they rely on the AiXPAND network of processing nodes where they deploy using their own processing node all the required processing pipelines including models and business logic. While traveling to various projects locations the processing pipelines are automatically deployed to nearby regional processing nodes through web3 microtransactions thus not requiring any complex Cloud compute resources or a mobile fleet of edge devices. Nevertheless, our entrepreneurs acquire a minimal set of inexpensive Cloud resources in order to deploy their UI/UX web-app that consumes the backend output from the AiXPAND processing nodes.&#x20;
