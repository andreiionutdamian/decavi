# The Expansion

At some point our entrepreneurs decide to upgrade their ecosystem by employing smart drone-based data acquisition. They acquire a small fleet of UAVs that have basic GPU compute capabilities (using on-board Nvidia Jetson device) and associate each unit with a Node Deed while deploying the AiXPAND processing node software on each one. They quickly discover that using the power of web3 AiXPAND network they can efficiently "rent" - based on microtransactions - their UAVs in different regions and scenarios that are actually outside the scope of their services - all these directly controlled by them and only when the drones are not performing complex site surveillance and computing jobs.
