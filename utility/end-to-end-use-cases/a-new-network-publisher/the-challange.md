# The challange

In terms of internal resources and expertise our scenario entrepreneurs, being in the branch for quite some time and previously providing consultancy services such as these for their former employers,  already have the much needed know-how in the area of _Data Science_. Their gained expertise previously aided them in constructing two important AI models: (A) one that is able to ingest wind-turbine related images taken from special designed cranes or drones and then output potential defect detections; (B) a model that ingests end-user historical consumption and outputs demand forecasting. These two particular models our entrepreneurs have developed have already proven successful in previous consultancy projects giving them enough confidence to start their own managed services business.

While preparing the business plan the entrepreneurs outline a clear path for constructing their own team, infrastructure and toolset while identifying two major challenges.&#x20;

1. They quickly realize simple external tools are not sufficient and a internal product must be developed to meet multiple customer needs and pave the way for online managed services. This particular challenge consists in two major components: (i) developing a multi-tenant user experience that will allow both the interaction between them and the data, insights and report as well as the interaction between the customer and the results - either automated reports or reports resulting from managed services; (ii) developing a backend system that will allow them to perform multi-modal data acquisition - such as data from sensors, consumption, images from the on-site equipment, etc. - execute their already designed  models, automatically post process the inference and prediction results and finally prepare and deploy the result in the user interfaces previously mentioned. Based on their experience, they quickly realize that while for first component - that of UX/UI - they can easily tender and externalize the workload at minimal costs for the second component multiple streams are required - from DevSecOps to MLOps to RTOS programming - and the budget for all these is quite high. &#x20;
2. Another major challenge is the high "volatility" of compute power requirements through time and location - basically their services, even though are mostly delivered based on repetitive schedules and multi-annual contracts, have dramatic ups and downs in terms of compute power usage and in-site / on-location requirements. They quickly realize that ideally they need both on-prem compute capability as well as powerful cloud compute capability - both which drastically raise their required investment - both CAPEX and OPEX. Another major issue is that they cannot directly tie the revenue to the compute expenses meaning the compute environment - both cloud and on-prem - must be paid for and pre-configured prior to any one-shot or recurring project.&#x20;
