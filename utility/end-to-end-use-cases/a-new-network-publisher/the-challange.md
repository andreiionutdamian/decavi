# The challange

In terms of internal resources and expertise our scenario entrepreneurs, being in the branch for quite some time and previously providing consultancy services such as these for their former employers,  already have the needed know-how in the area of Data Science. Their gained expertise previously aided them in constructing two important AI models: (A) one that is able to ingest wind-turbine related images taken from special designed cranes or drones and then output potential defect detections; (B) a model that ingests end-user historical consumption and outputs demand forecasting. These two particular models our entrepreneurs have developed have already proven successful in previous consultancy projects giving them enough confidence to start their own managed services business.

While preparing the business plan the entrepreneurs outline a clear path for constructing their own team, infrastructure and toolset. They quickly realize simple external tools are not sufficient and a internal product must be developed to meet multiple customer needs and pave the way for online managed services.
