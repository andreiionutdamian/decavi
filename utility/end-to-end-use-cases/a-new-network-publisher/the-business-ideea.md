# The business ideea

A small teams of experts in _**renewable energy**_ with experience in the area of wind turbine farms as well as solar panels wants to establish a managed services company specialized in helping renewable energy producers (wind and solar power farms) in the process of maintaining their equipment as well as offering consumption and load balancing prediction. The two main use cases that they want to address are:

* early detection of various defects such as propeller micro-fissures, internal turbine components and other elements that might indicate **future failures and thus are ideal predictive maintenance methodologies** as the defects can be fixed with minimal costs.
* multi-tenant and multi-farm big-data aggregation followed by predictive analytics processing both remotely as well as on-the-spot in farm sites. Using this approach the service company can provide their customers with monthly reports that present **forecasting information based on AI predictions**.
