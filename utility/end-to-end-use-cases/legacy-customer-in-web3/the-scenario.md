# The scenario

In this scenario the SME (a small or medium enterprise) owns a network for 10 shops in various locations and has already in-place analog and digital CCTV for security purposes requiring the addition of AI without new advanced infrastructure: basically the client needs AI-based security and shop employee safety as well as smart merchandising and management services including: raising automatic alerts if a person falls down, a gun or a aggressive behavior is discovered by the AI, a queue is formed or is predicted by the AI, a display stand is not respecting specific merchandising conformity rules or specific products are missing or not restocked from certain shelves. So far this scenarios is a classic example of Web2 technology empowered by Artificial Intelligence technology such as Deep Learning, however in this case we have the following details: almost no two locations have identical configurations in terms of shop space, CCTV cameras and even active personnel due to the fact that each shop is serving different populations / demographics. Thus a shop might have 2 video streams while another might have 10 CCTV cameras resulting in the locally deployed edge devices being utilized at various degrees - from a mere 15% up to an overwhelming 99%.
