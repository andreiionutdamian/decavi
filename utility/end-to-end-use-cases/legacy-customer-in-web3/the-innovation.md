# The innovation

Using the blockchain heterogenous decentralized architecture provided by our ecosystem the SME’s network of 10 locations will be able to **balance the resource load and redirect AI processing jobs from the overwhelmed nodes to the nodes that are under-used**. Nevertheless, in certain periods of the year - say when a monthly inventory must be carried out or when a video surveillance recording must be processed for confidentiality reasons an extra boost of power is required, an extra boost that loads to the maximum all the processing nodes and still does not cover all the needed power. While these highly complex jobs still can be done in a specific amount of time - say leaving the majority of nodes to work fully overnight while maybe disabling features that are not critical - the SME requires fast processing time and does not want to compromise by temporarily stopping features and processes. Clearly, this is the classic scenario when the SME either purchases more on-premise compute power or provisions more Cloud IaaS. However, at this point we are employing the power of Web3 in order to efficiently automate the provisioning of the required resources. Thus the needed boost of power is automatically “purchased” from other network participants exactly as in the case where the 10 processing nodes balance themselves (at no cost). Basically, after the SME’s network of 10 locations has exhausted - without paying any fees - the capacity by loading up all the underused nodes, it will request to the outside world processing power to nearby (let us say in the same geographic region) nodes by providing a small PoAI (Proof-of-AI) miner processing fee. That's not all because, as we previously mentioned, most of the time the SME’s network is able to balance itself and even have, let us say for the sake of the example, a couple of still underused nodes during day and double that during nighttime. As a result, all the time there are underused nodes that, if the SME accepts, can be automatically used by external nodes and thus **literally generate passive income for their “AI land deed” (licensing non-fungible token) owner**.
