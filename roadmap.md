1. **Whitepaper, litepaper, tokenomics and live demos preparation**
2. Release of the **collectible NFT pre-projec**t: a set of loyalty tokens for team members
3. **Launching phase:**
   1. **Token BEP-20 preparation & audit**
   2. Demo Blur WebApp:
   3. (Binance) IEO
4. Box-node factory:
   1. End-to-end factory process for box-nodes (HW+SW)
   2. Release of **security-NFTs** for existing box-nodes
5. **Start of CAVI tokens revenue streams - First stage** - initial revenue streams will only be available for paying customers (users that pay node license one-time and/or periodic) by migrating and boosting all discounting schemes towards token economy. This will be “default” PoAI
6. Deployment basic core functionalities in already existing product:
   1. Blockchain secure transactions
   2. homomorphic data encryption
   3. federated learning & inference
7. **CAVI tokens revenue streams - Second stage** - as soon as job distributions become more and more usual - will allow token minting based on pure job-based PoAI.
8. **Deployment of automated labeling system**: users will be able to enable a feature that collects data from their streams or from remotely received streams and uses local AI in order to label and improve AI training datasets. See Data provider - passive - User D1: small/medium user…
9. **Launch of s-Box** - software only box that enables custom new decentralized projects and can be downloaded and deployed
10. **Deployment of manual data labeling jobs**: participants will be able receive data labeling jobs and get rewarded for the work. See Data provided - active: User D2: small/medium user…
11. Launch of app marketplace
12. All code is published open-source
13. Network starts to receive projects that run decentralized: At this stage ecosystem participants will be able to deploy their own systems without any actual features/ties to existing safety, security or analytics ones.
14. **Establish DAO legal infrastructure**
15. **Finally the network becomes independent of the founder company when a minimal yet critical mass of independent projects use the MLOps ecosystem based on the decentralized network**
