# The plugin system

The "plugin system" is a core concept of the node's AiXPAND Execution Engine software. Basically all usual modules and stages of a software system - such as getting data from the corporate databases, performing complex analytics or applying AI models, processing data into reports, serving those reports to a API - all these are designed in the Execution Engine as plugins: you can quickly use something that has already been developed by others or "extend"/"reuse" a base one and create your own custom plugin for any stage/process you need. Whether you need your own node to watch for your pets using your wall-mounted camera or you want your node to sort your business incoming electronic ticketing system requests - you need plugins (AI plugins, business plugins, etc). For these you can get help from vendors (devs in the AiXPAND ecosystem) or you can do it yourself and pay no monthly license fee :). Now, if someone else wants to use your node for a distributed & decentralized PoAI job - lets say the AiXPAND ecosystem Motionmask participant wants to use your node together with other 100 nodes to get help in blurring people faces in a 12 hours long CCTV movie - then Motionmask will use on their node(s) their own custom plugin but on your node they will "call" some audited, safe, secure plugin(s) that perform that remote job of movie piece (1/100) blurring - all this while respecting Motionmask customer confidentiality \[still work in progress as of 2022-09-27 on the full confidentiality part]. Nonetheless, all these are automated by the AiXPAND Execution Engine. In conclusion: if you need some custom stuff done on your node you can get help or you can custom build yourself however if others want to use your node there are special & audited plugins that are used (and that usually you should not be responsible to install or pay).
