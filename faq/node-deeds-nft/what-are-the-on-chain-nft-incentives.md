# What are the on-chain NFT incentives?

While in a classic scenario a customer will receive a discount for volume or time spent as a loyal customer in our case we plan to take this to the next level and make the customer an actual owner of a unique smart contract that is able to generate passive revenue and even has a face value. One of the most important aspects of the PoAI is that the rewards are tied to the owners of blockchain based smart contracts. These smart contracts are unique and minted in the form of non fungible tokens NFT. Each individual NFT has one or even more boxes attached to it and thus is able to generate for its owner rewards based on the jobs and the reliability of the underlying boxes. As mentioned above each individual NFT will also have a piece of unique art attached to it that would uniquely identify the owner as well as allow the owner to sell the NFT in certain exchanges even if the boxes tied to the NFT are no longer valid. In short: the node-associated security NFT can be seen as the node license. Each individual security NFT will have several properties such as max number of nodes, max number of GPUs per node, together with the MAC & IP addresses of the associated nodes.
