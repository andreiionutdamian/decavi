# How can a NFT transfer the ownership of the rewards?

Each individual NFT is minted either as a companion to a box or to a set of boxes - i.e. the licenses. The smart contract rules coded on-chain in each NFT allow that any new owner to be the main beneficiary of the rewards generated by the associated boxes PoAI. The transfer can be done on-chain wallet-to-wallet transfer or from a sale in a centralized or decentralized exchange. Note that multiple security smart contracts can transfer rewarded utility tokens to the same wallet address.
