# Who receives the NFT generated crypto coins rewards?

While each NFT sends the associated box PoAI rewards in the form of a certain amount of utility tokens for its owner - even in the case the owner of the NFT is different from the owner of the boxes - a certain amount of the rewards are distributed also towards the maintainers of the box. So basically, even if the NFT changes ownership and the box stays with the previous owner, the PoAI rewards for the maintainers will still be distributed to them. Maintainers are both the account manager that sold/delivered the box as well as the technicians that offer the box support. This incentivisation approach encourages all parties to support a good functioning and continuous availability of the box. Remember: if the box stops working the NFT smart contract will have no rewards to deliver to anyone, again if the box works just 12/24 then the associated NFT will generate a small portion of the potential revenues.
