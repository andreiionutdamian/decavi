# Can security NFT be traded without an already working/existing box(es)?

Yes. The NFTs - especially security NFT - can be freely minted and traded in the open markets even if there is no actual box-node (as box-node software or as full hardware-software stack) associated with the NFT at the minting time or at the marketplace listing time. This way network participants can secure their fleets of licenses even before they own the functional box-node (fully physical or software-only installed). Nevertheless, multiple types of security NFT will be released and only maintainer-NFT will be free for minting: for participants that will act as opportunistic passive network maintainers - those that only provide computer power without any other value added services). The minting process of maintainer NFT will have a gradually increasing pricing mechanism in order to limit the compute power inflation.
