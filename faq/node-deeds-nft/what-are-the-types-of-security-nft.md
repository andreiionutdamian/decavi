# What are the types of security NFT?

As mentioned above we will have multiple types of security-like NFTs that will act as licenses for compute nodes and will reward the owners based on their smart-contract rules. There will be multiple sub-types of security NFT and at this moment there are three main categories: Maintainer NFT: these NFTs will act as licenses for nodes used by opportunistic users that use their boxes just to provide compute power in the network User NFT: these NFTs will be associated with the nodes of end-consumers Partner NFT: will be minted for the network partners that will develop functionalities and/or implement functionalities for end-consumers (who in turn will receive User NFT)
