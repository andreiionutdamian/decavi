# How about known environmental issues usually associated with blockchain?

Our aim is to architect as well as produce and deploy low energy and low carbon footprint edge devices able to collaboratively process jobs that are usually requiring huge amounts of energy and carbon footprint. The collaborative processing is based on the blockchain ecosystem as well as…. Aside from this approach we also look forward to developing further eco-friendly initiatives that will offset the carbon footprint of minted NFTs (usually residing and delivered as ERC-20 or BEP-20 tokens). Carbon-offsetting will be achieved also through CSR activities such as “planting a tree for each box” - that is planting a tree minted security NFT. More information will be provided as we are working on further developing and searching for potential partnerships that will allow us to materialize these plans.
