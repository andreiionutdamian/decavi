# Will there be a limit of all nodes?

PoAI Worker Zones will be defined with specific incentivisation methods based on location and geographical area jobs in order to minimize upload/download time based on MAN and WAN bandwidth. Beside the communication aspects handled by geographical zoning it is important to safely control compute power inflation within the ecosystem. For this matter we will be planning on restricting the total number of regional installable box-nodes for compute power. Nevertheless, if an end-user requires a box-node that is not used as a compute-power provider a different license will be used. Besides limiting the zone size the node licenses for computer-only nodes will gradually increase in order to offer a economically sustainable environment - eg. node licenses bought later on will be more expensive but this will be sustained by the increase of network load.
