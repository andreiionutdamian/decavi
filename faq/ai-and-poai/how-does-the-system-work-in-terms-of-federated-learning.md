# How does the system work in terms of Federated Learning?

The network and the overall ecosystem works with two types of nodes: the box-nodes for local and remote job processing as well as the CAVI client-nodes. In terms of scenarios the ecosystem can support both fully decentralized distributed Federated Learning jobs as well as central node based jobs where both a box-node or a CAVI client-node can act as a central aggregation node.
