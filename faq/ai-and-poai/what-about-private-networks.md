# What about private networks?

For the particular case of an enterprise that has all its boxes working in a closed private network there will be no method of sharing any spare resources with the external environment and executing any AI jobs with the available compute power. For this particular case the enterprise will still fully benefit from two major features: blockchain based security and anti-tampering mechanisms as well as private distributed federated deep learning and inference. In short the decentralized network of boxes will protect each and all boxes from tampering (configuration and alert/event tampering) as well as re-distribute jobs from overloaded nodes to nodes with higher compute availability while respecting bandwidth restrictions. Aside from this built-in private blockchain features the enterprise users will receive a certain number of NFTs. Although these NFTs will not be able to generate utility tokens for the consumers they will still generate reward tokens for the maintainers while having the same properties as all the other NFTs: uniques and ownership transferring. IMPORTANT: For the particular case of private networks and one or multiple boxes running within a private network the accompany NFT will communicate with the “connected” box-nodes through a proxy app enabled by the private network owner on the infrastructure border - if the app is not allowed to proxy the usage-only data between the private network and the on-chain NFT then no rewards will be distributed to the owner as well as to the maintainers.
