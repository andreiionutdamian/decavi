# How can a miner easily migrate from PoW (various tokens) to PoAI?

Currently our box-node software supports CUDA-based tensorial operations and uses the top two well known Deep Learning frameworks - Tensorflow and Pytorch - besides other CPU-based shallow Machine Learning technologies such as Scikit Learn and XGBoost. In the first stage of the Project we will streamline the migration process for the miners that are using Nvidia GPUs and also support CPU-only box-nodes for non-deep learning jobs. The system already supports multi-GPU on the same box-node. We will then continue to invest in the box-node deep learning tensorial framework backend capabilities and compatibility in order to be able to support non-CUDA devices. An important observation is that a box node is able to deliver compute power and process almost any kind of jobs on CPU even though for most operations is suboptimal compared with CUDA.
