# ? Network: How do you deal with low network bandwidths?

Low bandwidth or high latency is a real issue for a lot of projects that tackle areas such as IoT, AI and blockchain. Our PoAI based blockchain allows the distribution of the jobs depending on the peer-to-peer bandwidth capabilities as well as the latency. Aside from using optimized peer-to-peer bandwidth balancing the system employs AI-based encryption and compression methods ensuring that no large amounts of data are transferred unless explicitly required.
