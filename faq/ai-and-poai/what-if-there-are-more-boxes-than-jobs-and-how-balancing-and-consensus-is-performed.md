# What if there are more boxes than jobs and how balancing and consensus is performed?

The network does not rely on luck on arbitrary choosing of the rewarded box. All the nodes are awarded proportionally to the overall distribution of the remote jobs and overall AI job execution and the only aspect that makes a difference between a box from another is the compute capability - dependent of what features and hardware was purchases - and the reliability of that box - how long and how reliable the box has been running. The parachain PoAI internal consensus mechanism takes into account the following aspects when distributing job-shards (based on data-shards): Validator-like nodes will act as communication proxies for their near-nodes and will communicate with each other in order to maintain the map (directed graph map) Geolocation of the node in relation with other boxes correlates with the bandwidth. We define the concept of Near-nodes as the nodes adjacent with a given node based on bandwidth. Observation: geolocation closeness is correlated with good bandwidth but does not directly imply good bandwidth between two nodes The compute capability of the “near-nodes” Periodic checks with the zone main node (validator like node) can lead to migration
