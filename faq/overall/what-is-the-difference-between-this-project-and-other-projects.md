# What is the difference between this project and other projects?

Multiple aspects set us apart from our competitors - either blockchain/decentralized projects or classic/legacy systems so lets break down the main advantages and differences based on this root taxonomy: Differences between our system and other classic providers of AI edge compute particularly in security & safety applications (video analytics, etc): Versatility: our solutions has been designed with a very powerful feature related to versatility, adaptability and scalability - the plugin system that allows a partner, distributor, developer or even a end-consumer to adapt, modify existing features, create new features within the system based on previous ones or even construct processing pipelines that have radically different purposes than those already deployed. In short, this approach allows the easy adaptation with low-code or even no-code plugins of almost any kind of data provider for the system, communication plugins, addition of new Machine Learning serving processes as well as creation of new business logic plugins. This brings a new level of adaptability to the system that allows the creation of processing pipelines/jobs within the device/solution for almost any target industry; Job distribution within a decentralized grid: probably our most powerful feature that puts us in a separate niche than all the known edge-based AI-processing solutions is the capability to distribute processing jobs such as AI / Deep Learning inference or neural model training within the grid of box-nodes. Evenmore each individual node can act individually both as a “server” or as a “client” with no pre-designed client-server nor centralized architecture or requirements. Blockchain based security: aside from node level security with multiple layers, a feature that most of the solutions on the market provide - from intelligent cameras to GPU based edge processing device, we use the power of blockchain technology to ensure a higher level of security and particularly immutability of the generated and distributed data and metadata. Even in the case of zero-day vulnerabilities or inside-based attacks the system uses blockchain and a simplified version of practical Bizantine Fault Tolerance in order to detect/discover any bit that has been tampered with and reject that information from the system. Major approaches and features that set us apart from other crypto-space projects: Proven technology: our solution is based on a proven architecture and working infrastructure that has already been tested in production environments prior even to the introduction of blockchain technology, decentralized processing and tokenomics. Aside from a past of many years of research, development and deployment (outside of crypto-space) we already included the most important aspects of the decentralization-based qualities of the solution such as: distribution of jobs, fully decentralized architectures, blockchain based immutability; Versatile and easy-to-start for any SaaS provider: this particular feature is similar to the versatility quality that sets us apart from classic solutions. In short, while known projects in crypto-space propose frameworks in various degrees of maturity and put the heavy R\&D load in the hands of partners and developers we propose a already functioning ecosystem that takes care of all the requirements such as communication within the network, data acquisition, AI model inference, prediction post processing with complex business rules, delivering results for consumption end-points. Aside from a read-to-use node environment that can be deployed as-is for varied applications such as video analytics or predictive analytics in use-cases such as commercial security, industrial safety, industrial supply chain, retail & distribution, we also provide application pipeline templates for other industries so that developers can quickly iterate through development and directly deploy their applications within the already in-place network Processing real-estate: last but not least we see each box-node as an AI-powered processing asset “land” asset of our decentralized network processing-Metaverse. Each individual node has its own Node Deed non-fungible token that entitles its owner to various rights including active (and even passive) revenue streams generated from the workload of the node, from usage of paid features or subscriptions or from the simple ownership of the Node Deed.
