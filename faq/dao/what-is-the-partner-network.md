# What is the partner network?

API framework platforms, databases, management information systems and most complex systems and software platforms rely on implementation partners and the underlying distribution and deployment network. From the pre-blockchain era our system has been developed with distribution and implementation partnership flexible scaling in mind. Minimization of adaptation/integration efforts, configuration and deployment without the need of expensive know-how such as Data Science or Deep Learning, simplicity of workflows - all these have been on our product roadmaps . Nevertheless, the introduction of the blockchain based decentralized ecosystem has a new set of features and options in store for our partner. Critical aspects such as ownership, reliability or internationalization strategy now have a new perspective. With the maturation of the decentralized network partners will be able to rely on each other rather than rely solely on a central technology provider while working in an international business environment rather than a local or regional area.
