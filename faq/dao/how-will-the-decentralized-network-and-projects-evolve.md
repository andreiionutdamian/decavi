# How will the decentralized network and projects evolve?

The project roadmap contains clear plans of releasing a software only box-node that will enable any willing distributed network participants to deploy their own capabilities or just provide PoAI capabilities. This specific step in the project roadmap will enable a new perspective of decentralized AI application development allowing execution of various jobs: from simple pre-made AI models that can be easily configured by non data scientists for various purposes up to complex custom-made deep learning models created by AI teams and distributedly executed in the network. Here are a few examples: Passive Compute - User A: passive network maintainer: User A has a powerful computer and good net connection A downloads the node and registers the node in the grid A receives income as long as the node is online Analytics use-case provider- User B: small project developer - demand forecasting B downloads the node and registers B connects local database to node B configures (no data science skills) the forecasting ML engine B sends train and prediction jobs in network B pays gas fees much smaller than major Cloud apps require for this job Data provider - passive - User D1: small/medium user/maintainer: D1 uses the box (sw and/or hw) for direct benefits - e.g. detecting personnel that do not comply to safety and health regulations D1 consumes computer power at maximum of device capability thus does not generate compute in the grid D1 generates data based on the usage of the system - e.g. pictures of personnel that does not use safety gear and/or medical face mask D1 contributes to the network with the pictures allowing other similar use-cases to improve themselves and receives reward. The whole security and safety of the data is automatically handled as the actual end-user does not interact with the datasets OBS: basically this active participant is similar to the passive except the fact that it is willing to participate with their own data to the ecosystem improvement and uses the box for use-cases that can be employed by other passive/active participants. Data provided - active: User D2: small/medium user/maintainer: D2 can be a user that does not use the box-node and the ecosystem for own needs D2 is able to allocate time and use human power to annotate datasets using the provided box-node and client-node D2 must stake some of the own funds to guarantee the quality of the data. This way bad practices - labeling randomly the observation, etc - used in various systems (such as Mechanical Turk) are avoided D2 jobs are peer-evaluated by other participants or by automated scripts that are already pre-trained for the given task and can verify if the labeling is off/random. If job is approved the stake will be released to D2 together with the rewards for the job Enterprise provider - User C: large project developer - complex system C downloads the node and registers Using more advanced skills the user develops a series of features for end-customers (existing of future) on top of the node C pays starting jobs gas fees and the node starts C customers use the services either on monthly fees or on-demand C receives generate revenue (CAVI) similar to a classic business but without requiring: specialized growing hw infrastructure, cloud provider dependency, proprietary frameworks, much lower marketing and internationalization costs and barriers.
