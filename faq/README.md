# FAQ

1.9.27. Aside from staking collateral, are there other methods of QA?

Aside from the collateral staking that network service providers have to set aside as guarantee for the quality of services rendered to the beneficiaries network participants, a peer-to-peer review system will ensure that a proposed service provider is also reviewed by already trusted network providers as well as beneficiaries in order to ensure feasibility of services, security of the approaches and other technical and usability aspects.

1.9.28. Blockchain: Difference between private box fleet vs public boxes?

As mentioned the system relies on two blockchains - a private one and a public one. The private one enables anti-tampering features for the boxes as well as job distribution and allows private and closed enterprises to deploy fleets of boxes and benefit from the full features. The public network enables distribution of jobs and the resulting PoAI and rewards at large scale via the NFT smart contracts and the utility token.

1.9.29. Network: How do you deal with low network bandwidths?

Low bandwidth or high latency is a real issue for a lot of projects that tackle areas such as IoT, AI and blockchain. Our PoAI based blockchain allows the distribution of the jobs depending on the peer-to-peer bandwidth capabilities as well as the latency. Aside from using optimized peer-to-peer bandwidth balancing the system employs AI-based encryption and compression methods ensuring that no large amounts of data are transferred unless explicitly required.



1.9.39. Investment: What are the financial investment options?

Together with the launching of the security smart contract NFTs and the utility token ICO, stacking and liquidity pool mechanisms will be offered for potentially interested investors. These classic electronic coin financial investment approaches will further promote and fuel the usage of the utility token. More information will be provided. While the main rewards generation system will be based on the PoAI consensus the CAVI token will run on ERC20/BEP20/â€¦ network based on PoS mechanics and thus allowing staking, liquidity pools and other digital DeFi options.
