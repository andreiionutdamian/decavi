# FAQ













1.9.27. Aside from staking collateral, are there other methods of QA?

Aside from the collateral staking that network service providers have to set aside as guarantee for the quality of services rendered to the beneficiaries network participants, a peer-to-peer review system will ensure that a proposed service provider is also reviewed by already trusted network providers as well as beneficiaries in order to ensure feasibility of services, security of the approaches and other technical and usability aspects.

1.9.28. Blockchain: Difference between private box fleet vs public boxes?

As mentioned the system relies on two blockchains - a private one and a public one. The private one enables anti-tampering features for the boxes as well as job distribution and allows private and closed enterprises to deploy fleets of boxes and benefit from the full features. The public network enables distribution of jobs and the resulting PoAI and rewards at large scale via the NFT smart contracts and the utility token.

1.9.29. Network: How do you deal with low network bandwidths?

Low bandwidth or high latency is a real issue for a lot of projects that tackle areas such as IoT, AI and blockchain. Our PoAI based blockchain allows the distribution of the jobs depending on the peer-to-peer bandwidth capabilities as well as the latency. Aside from using optimized peer-to-peer bandwidth balancing the system employs AI-based encryption and compression methods ensuring that no large amounts of data are transferred unless explicitly required.



1.9.39. Investment: What are the financial investment options?

Together with the launching of the security smart contract NFTs and the utility token ICO, stacking and liquidity pool mechanisms will be offered for potentially interested investors. These classic electronic coin financial investment approaches will further promote and fuel the usage of the utility token. More information will be provided. While the main rewards generation system will be based on the PoAI consensus the CAVI token will run on ERC20/BEP20/â€¦ network based on PoS mechanics and thus allowing staking, liquidity pools and other digital DeFi options.

1.9.40. Founders: Who are the founders?

1.9.41. Learning, societal, charity & academic support & responsibility

We have multiple options and proposal for network and overall organization social responsibility and giving back to the community: Grants that will allow communities without financial resources to deploy safety systems with focus on: Junior research: College and similar establishments - Programs enabling students and even younger children to develop and experiment with the ecosystem, create their own applications, deploy them on main-net and monetize the proposed ideas Advanced research: University and CS departments in particular where grad students and their instructors and supervisors can engage in advanced projects that would benefit the whole network. Professional research: Research organizations Competitions and hackathons that will enable construction of new dApps in the ecosystem as well as creation of new teams and participants entities

1.9.42. Learning: Will there be casual workshops and learn-to-earn campaigns?

In order to support the growth of our community we will periodically and gradually deploy online workshops that will include small quizzes. Passing the quiz will activate a faucet mechanism and a small amount of CAVI tokens will be delivered to the participants.

1.9.43. Certification: Will there be advanced courses and certifications?

Our plans include the creation of our Academy that will allow partners and even individuals to attend advanced tracks for developing complex applications using our ecosystem. The tracks can also include certification exams that will confer the attendants proof of verified skills and knowledge.
