# FAQ













1.9.27. Aside from staking collateral, are there other methods of QA?

Aside from the collateral staking that network service providers have to set aside as guarantee for the quality of services rendered to the beneficiaries network participants, a peer-to-peer review system will ensure that a proposed service provider is also reviewed by already trusted network providers as well as beneficiaries in order to ensure feasibility of services, security of the approaches and other technical and usability aspects.

1.9.28. Blockchain: Difference between private box fleet vs public boxes?

As mentioned the system relies on two blockchains - a private one and a public one. The private one enables anti-tampering features for the boxes as well as job distribution and allows private and closed enterprises to deploy fleets of boxes and benefit from the full features. The public network enables distribution of jobs and the resulting PoAI and rewards at large scale via the NFT smart contracts and the utility token.

1.9.29. Network: How do you deal with low network bandwidths?

Low bandwidth or high latency is a real issue for a lot of projects that tackle areas such as IoT, AI and blockchain. Our PoAI based blockchain allows the distribution of the jobs depending on the peer-to-peer bandwidth capabilities as well as the latency. Aside from using optimized peer-to-peer bandwidth balancing the system employs AI-based encryption and compression methods ensuring that no large amounts of data are transferred unless explicitly required.



1.9.34. Smart Cities: how about them? The foundation of this project resides in the years of work and experience of our team in the areas of safety, security and predictive analytics based on AI. It is also a fact that we are adding blockchain technology and decentralization ecosystem to an already working environment based on embedded devices running AI/Deep Learning based algorithms. One of the main range of already existing features address safety and security scenarios based on CCTV video streams and more. In Smart City environments our project can achieve two different important objectives: AI use cases and citizen participation both financial and technologically. AI features include optimized and green deployment of a grid of AI powered devices that would enable features like road safety, children areas security and safety, traffic and network balancing forecasting. Citizen participation is probably an even more important aspect: allow Smart City citizens to participate in the distributed grid of AI devices and reward them in the decentralized financial ecosystem. In short the Project will allow the address the following Smart City aspects: Build-in safety and security capabilities, based on a track-record of past projects and experience in the field, will enable deploying a decentralized grid of blockchain secured box-nodes that will be able to acquire classic CCTV signals as well as process other sources of data for various use-cases. Crowd funding the Smart City deployment through citizen participation. The Project will allow citizens to acquire box-nodes and put them to work in the decentralized Smart City grid of box-nodes. Thus, each participant will be able to get rewards from the system and the municipality will be able to crowdsource the project. Basically each participating citizen will be a shareholder of the municipality’s project. Connect, re-invest, finance through the decentralized financial system. Connecting the municipality project to the grid as well as cooperating with other similar smart city projects through sharing of knowledge and methodology will reap decentralized distributed workload for the municipality. The municipality will be able to use the generated tokens to re-invest in extending their own system or in other projects or just use the extra generated revenues in deposits, staking for providing PoS collateral to protocol consensus validator nodes or other methods that will yield annual revenue such as providing liquidity to decentralized exchanges that offer CAVI token swapping.



1.9.39. Investment: What are the financial investment options?

Together with the launching of the security smart contract NFTs and the utility token ICO, stacking and liquidity pool mechanisms will be offered for potentially interested investors. These classic electronic coin financial investment approaches will further promote and fuel the usage of the utility token. More information will be provided. While the main rewards generation system will be based on the PoAI consensus the CAVI token will run on ERC20/BEP20/… network based on PoS mechanics and thus allowing staking, liquidity pools and other digital DeFi options.

1.9.40. Founders: Who are the founders?

The founder information can be found [here](../team.md)

1.9.41. Learning, societal, charity & academic support & responsibility

We have multiple options and proposal for network and overall organization social responsibility and giving back to the community: Grants that will allow communities without financial resources to deploy safety systems with focus on: Junior research: College and similar establishments - Programs enabling students and even younger children to develop and experiment with the ecosystem, create their own applications, deploy them on main-net and monetize the proposed ideas Advanced research: University and CS departments in particular where grad students and their instructors and supervisors can engage in advanced projects that would benefit the whole network. Professional research: Research organizations Competitions and hackathons that will enable construction of new dApps in the ecosystem as well as creation of new teams and participants entities

1.9.42. Learning: Will there be casual workshops and learn-to-earn campaigns?

In order to support the growth of our community we will periodically and gradually deploy online workshops that will include small quizzes. Passing the quiz will activate a faucet mechanism and a small amount of CAVI tokens will be delivered to the participants.

1.9.43. Certification: Will there be advanced courses and certifications?

Our plans include the creation of our Academy that will allow partners and even individuals to attend advanced tracks for developing complex applications using our ecosystem. The tracks can also include certification exams that will confer the attendants proof of verified skills and knowledge.
